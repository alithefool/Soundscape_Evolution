I want to build a native desktop media player app for Linux called "Soundscape Evolution". It's an offline application that loads and plays local audio files (MP3/WAV), and generates a real-time visualizer based on Conway’s Game of Life.

The visualizer reacts to audio input by influencing the Game of Life simulation in real time. For example:
- Bass frequencies increase cell birth rate.
- Mid frequencies tweak survival rules or mutation rate.
- Treble affects color, animation speed, or pattern transitions.

Here's what I want:

1. **Platform**: Target native Linux. Prefer C++, Python (with PyQt or Pygame), Rust, or another performant cross-platform language. No need for web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Electron).

2. **Features**:
- Load local audio files (MP3/WAV).
- Play, pause, and stop audio.
- Display real-time Game of Life simulation on a window.
- Use FFT or frequency analysis to drive changes in the simulation.
- Fullscreen toggle.
- Lightweight GUI or SDL window (no unnecessary UI bloat).
- Basic configuration panel (can be CLI-based or basic GUI): simulation speed, grid size, audio sensitivity.

3. **Tech Stack Options** (pick the one that makes sense):
- **C++ with SDL2 and libsndfile / PortAudio / FFmpeg**.
- **Rust with rodio + cpal + SDL2 or minifb**.
- **Python with PyGame or PyQt5 + pydub or librosa for audio analysis**.

4. **Output**:
- Complete codebase with clearly separated modules (audio input, FFT analysis, simulation engine, rendering).
- A `main.cpp`, `main.rs`, or `main.py` file to run the app.
- Basic instructions in a README for dependencies and running on Linux.
- Inline comments explaining key parts (especially the audio-visual link).
- Use a test audio file or provide instructions to test with user files.

Title: **Soundscape Evolution**

The goal is a compact, performant, native media player with a beautiful, reactive Game of Life visualizer that runs offline on Linux. Generate the full project code and explain the key architecture.






The current idea is!

A Rust implementation is an excellent choice for Soundscape Evolution if you're aiming for:
    • High performance (real-time audio + rendering),
    • Full offline operation,
    • Fine-grained control over audio and graphics,
    • And better long-term stability than scripting languages.
Here’s a complete Rust implementation plan, including crates and architecture.

🔄 Runtime Flow
    1. Audio File Loaded
        ◦ Use rodio + symphonia to decode and stream the audio file.
        ◦ Buffer small frames for analysis in parallel.
    2. Real-Time Audio Analysis
        ◦ For each small audio frame (e.g. 1024 samples), run FFT.
        ◦ Split frequencies into bands:
            ▪ Bass → cell birth rate.
            ▪ Mids → survival/death tweaks.
            ▪ Treble → color palette, animation speed.
    3. Game of Life Engine
        ◦ Classic GOL grid with adjustable size.
        ◦ Apply rule changes per frame based on audio bands.
        ◦ Evolve each frame based on modified rules.
    4. Rendering
        ◦ Use pixels (or wgpu for GPU rendering) to draw grid cells.
        ◦ Color intensity, animation, fade-outs based on FFT values.
    5. Loop
        ◦ Use winit event loop to handle windowing.
        ◦ On each tick:
            ▪ Pull next audio frame.
            ▪ Analyze FFT.
            ▪ Update simulation.
            ▪ Redraw canvas.

🧪 Start With This MVP
    • Load and play an MP3/WAV file with rodio.
    • Display a window with a static Game of Life simulation using pixels.
    • Add FFT using rustfft on streamed audio frames.
    • Drive grid updates using real-time audio band energy.

📦 Sample Crate Dependencies (Cargo.toml)
[dependencies]
rodio = "0.17"
symphonia = { version = "0.5", features = ["mp3"] }
rustfft = "6.0"
pixels = "0.13"
winit = "0.29"

Would you like me to generate the starter Cargo.toml and some initial main.rs code for the audio + rendering loop?
